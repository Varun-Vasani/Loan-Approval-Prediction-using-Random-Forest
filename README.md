# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
The dataset for this project originates from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), which has been providing loan guarantees to small businesses across the United States. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a small business loan will default based on historical data provided by the SBA.

Small businesses are vital for job creation in the U.S., and SBA loans play a significant role in supporting the growth of these businesses. However, while many small businesses have flourished with SBA-guaranteed loans, others have defaulted. By predicting the likelihood of loan defaults, the model can help in improving decision-making processes regarding loan approvals.
